# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a Java-based GUI application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It provides an interactive way to learn and understand sorting algorithms by animating their operations on arrays.

## Features
- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Interactive controls to start, pause, and reset the sorting process
- Dynamic array creation and visualization
- Step-by-step animation of sorting operations
